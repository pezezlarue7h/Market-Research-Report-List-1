<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPU Water Cooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Active Water Cooling</li><li>Passive Water Cooling </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CPU water cooler market is primarily divided into two types: active water cooling and passive water cooling. Active water cooling systems utilize pumps to circulate coolant through a closed-loop system, effectively transferring heat away from the CPU. They often provide better cooling performance, catering to gamers and overclockers. Conversely, passive water cooling relies on natural convection without pumps, utilizing heat sinks and larger surface areas to dissipate heat quietly and efficiently, making them suitable for low-power systems or noise-sensitive environments.</p></p>
