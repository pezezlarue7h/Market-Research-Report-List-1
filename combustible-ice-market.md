<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Combustible Ice Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ocean Generation</li><li>Continent Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The combustible ice market is categorized into two main types based on generation location: ocean generation and continent generation. Ocean generation refers to methane hydrates found beneath the seabed, harvested from oceanic environments, offering access to vast reserves. Continent generation, on the other hand, involves methane hydrates located in permafrost regions and continental sediments, typically easier to explore and extract due to their proximity to land. Both types present unique opportunities and challenges for energy production and environmental impact management.</p></p>
